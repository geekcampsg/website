This talk is all about how you can use DevPod to run your developer workloads easily.</p>\n<p>By the end of this talk, you'll be able to save costs without vendor lock-in with the open-source tool and the devcontainer.json specification that makes it compatible with VS Code and many other IDEs, as well as tools like Codespaces. Let's explore how DevPod works and dive into a quick demo that showcases how it can help developers and teams standardize their development environments.</p>\n",
